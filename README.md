     "mcpServers": {
       "moneybird": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y",
           "moneybird-mcp-server"
         ],
         "env": {
           "MONEYBIRD_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token_here",
           "MONEYBIRD_ADMINISTRATION_ID": "your_administration_id_here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** to apply the changes

4. **Connect to the MCP server** by typing `/mcp moneybird` in the Claude chat input
